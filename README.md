# Breief Theory


##Rules of stability in ABL:

1.	Unstable:
•	Light winds and surface warmer than air 
•	Sunny days in fair- weather /or
•	Cold air blows over a warmer surface (day or night)

2.	Stable:
•	Light winds and surface cooler than air 
•	Nights in fair- weather and clear skies /or 
•	Warm air blows over a warmer surface (day or night)
Note: Turbulence is weak or sometimes nonexistent in stable layers adjacent to the ground. 
3.	Neutral:
•	Winds are moderate to strong
•	Little heating or cooling from the surface
•	Overcast conditions often associated with bad weather 
•	Characteristic of residual layer
